### openid/iGov repo
Using Bitbucket and XML for this spec has been frustrating.
A big PR overwhlmed the [diff](https://bitbucket.org/openid/igov/diff/openid-igov-oauth2-1_0.xml?diff2=8be241f6972540a55d8fe68d4fff0f7428386fd8) so we're about to lose all our incremental changes. 
We've had major problems with conflicting PRs, even though they don't appear to actually conflict.

This will test to see if GitHub can parse this [PR](https://bitbucket.org/openid/igov/pull-requests/45) better from this point forward.

Also, we want to 
- leverage workflows for the xml2rfc build of html and txt
- start the process of converting to Kramdown/Markdown (script + manual labor)
- get to WGLC
